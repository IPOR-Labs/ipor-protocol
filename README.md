IPOR smart contracts

## Job statuses

-   [![CI](https://github.com/IPOR-Labs/ipor-protocol/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/IPOR-Labs/ipor-protocol/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
-   [![CD](https://github.com/IPOR-Labs/ipor-protocol/actions/workflows/cd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/IPOR-Labs/ipor-protocol/actions/workflows/cd.yml)

## Usage

### Pre-run steps

-   Install `python3-pip`.
-   Install `solc-select` using pip: `pip3 install solc-select`
-   Install docker and docker-compose
-   Install `node` and `npm`.
-   Install `truffle` : `npm install -g truffle`
-   Check truffle binary execution permission. Run `chmod +x truffle` in binary dir if execution flag is missing.
-   Run `sudo apt-get install build-essential`

### How to run as developer?

1. Clone `ipor-protocol` repository.
2. In directory `ipor-protocol` configure `.env` file based on `.env-local.j2`
3. In directory `ipor-protocol/containers/dev-tool` configure `.env` file based on `.env-local.j2`
4. Execute script `./run.sh` with specific commands in order like below:
    - `b` - build docker containers
    - `r` - run docker-compose
    - `m` - migrate Smart Contracts to blockchain
    - `b` - build docker containers with migrated smart contract addresses
    - `r` - run docker-compose once again
5. Application will be available at `http://localhost:4000`
6. Local blockchain will be available at `http://localhost:9545` `chainId = 5777`
7. Local blockchain explorer will be available at `http://localhost:9055`
8. Before you can open the address `http://localhost:4000` connect to local blockchain using Metamask
    - In Metamask choose `Custom RPC`
    - Enter network name `localhost`
    - Enter New RPC URL: `http://localhost:9545`
    - Enter Chain ID: `5777`
    - Click `Save`

### How to execute migrations locally?

-   Migration is executed with the use of Truffle
-   In `.env` file setup migration folder `SC_MIGRATION_DIRECTORY` which should point to one of subfolder in folder `./ipor-protocol/migrations/envs`
-   In `.env` file setup network name `ETH_BC_NETWORK_NAME` which should correspond to one of network names defined in `truffle-config.js`
-   In command line execute `./run.sh m` for incremental migration or `./run.sh mc` if you want to migrate all new smart contracts from scratch

### How to execute migrations using git tags?

-   You can start migration as default. Start from last completed migration to latest:
-   ./migrate.sh
-   Start from 5th migration to latest
-   ./migrate.sh --start-from-migration 5
-   Start from 5th migration to 10th migration 
-   ./migrate.sh --start-from-migration 5 --migrate-to 10
-   Start migration in dry run mode - you will see only migration logs without running migration commands
-   ./migration.sh --dry-run
-   Change default tag name prefix "migration-" to "audit-"
-   ./migration.sh --tag-prefix "audit-"

### How to execute smart contracts migrations remotely?

-   On remote server all parameters in `.env` are already prepared, you should not modify them without consultation with IT Team.
-   For `dev` in command line execute: `ssh ipor-dev-warren`, for `Rinkeby` in command line execute: `ssh ipor-rinkeby-sc-deploy`
-   `cd repos/ipor-protocol`
-   `git pull`
-   `./run.sh m mlogs`
-   `./run.sh p`
-   `exit`

### How to deploy new version of `Cockpit` on `Rinkeby` environment?

Do following steps:

-   Go to Github Actions in `ipor-protocol` repository
-   Select `Deploy Cockpit` -> Run workflow:
-   Select branch: `env/rinkeby`
-   IPOR cockpit Amplify application name: `ipor-rinkeby-cockpit`

#### How to run all tests?

`npm run test`

#### How to run all tests with coverage?

`npx hardhat coverage`

Coverage reports available in `coverage` folder.

#### How to run tests inside specific file with coverage for mainnet fork?

`export FORK_ENABLED=true; npx hardhat coverage --testfiles "test/vault/mainnet-fork/stanley-aave-dai.ts"`

Notice! `npx hardhat coverage` not includes coverage from tests in mainnet fork, this test coverage should be executed separately on every file.

#### How to run tests for specific file?

`npx hardhat test test/MiltonSpread.test.js`

#### How to run all tests with additional logs?

`npx hardhat test --logs`

### How to extract all error codes from solidity codes to json file?

`npm run export-errorCodes`

#### How to check contract size?

Run in command line: `truffle run contract-size`

#### How to generate documentation with markdown?

Run in command line: `yarn run hardhat docgen --theme markdown`

#### How to reset Ethereum blockchain state?

Run in command line: `./run.sh c`

### Environment variables configuration

#### COMPOSE_PROFILE

Docker compose profile used to run containers selectively, locally developer should use: `developer`
other available options:

-   developer - run containers needed to work locally as a developer, so without ssl containers
-   eth-bc-provider - run containers needed to serve Ethereum blockchain on remote server
-   eth-explorer-provider - run containers needed to serve Ethereum blockchain explorer on remote server
-   explorer - run only Ethereum blockchain explorer
-   dev-tool - run only dev-tool
-   ssl-eth-bc - run only ssl containers needed for Ethereum blockchain
-   ssl-explorer - run only ssl containers needed for Ethereum blockchain explorer
-   all - run all containers
